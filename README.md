# Velcro - an explicit, minimal WYSIWYG SSG

## Why Velcro?

_**Velcro work FOR YOU**_.

We are entering an era where framework fatigue is getting real. We are tired of concering over hooks, state, templates, shortcodes, and other bullsh*t created to one-up competiton. Websites have gotten slower and slower and increasingly indistinguishable. We have lost our individuality as developers - everyone is using the same three UI component libraries, or the same three Hugo templates. Express yourselves, CSS is not hard.

As Jekyll and Hugo fight for the limelight, they keep shovelling in more and more bloat and complexity. Just look at the size of their documentation! In the time it took to fully understand all of the different quirks of the tool, you probably could have written ten new blog posts.
We, as developers, have grown complacent with bloat and unnecessary complexity.

The Velcro workflow is simple. You run your `init` command once and then you can `build` from that point forward. No more distractions. Focus on what matters, your writing.

Velcro is for my fellow hackers and minimalists. It's for those who understand that simplicity is king. 
Each post is a folder and everything inside that folder belongs to that post. Asset scoping is dead simple - you have your assets folder that can be accessed globally, or your individual per-post assets.
What you see in your directory is exactly what you get in the browser.

Velcro is about going back to basics. These days everything is abstracted a hundred times over. With Velcro you only need a very basic config, some HTML, and optional styles
No more hooks, pipes, shortcodes, and other unnecessary complexity. You always know exactly what your codebase does and how it will react to your changes.
You write your post, you build, and you publish. That is it.
